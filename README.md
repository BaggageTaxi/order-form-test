Order form test
----------------

This is a testing playground of the order form.

The code has been initially generated by ChatGPT.

The form uses the following mock API endpoints:
* Mockapi.io: price calculation (see [`price-calculator.js`](./price-calculator.js))
* Mocky.io: available timeslots (see [`pickup-datetime.js`](./pickup-datetime.js), [`dropoff-datetime.js`](./dropoff-datetime.js))
* Webhook.site: submits the final form data
